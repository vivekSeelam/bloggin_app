This text file contains the resources I have used to create this blogging app:

https://djangocentral.com/building-a-blog-application-with-django/
admin site:
username: admin
emailaddress: vivek.seelam29@gmail.com
password: VivekDjangoProject

Well that was fast enough,
1. people have to type http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ and then create a new user and login 
2. create content there
3. But maybe this is only for me. which makes sense because I want to say something and put it on the internet

Next part is trying to get Twitter trends

https://wordpress.com/post/hangryowl.wordpress.com -- is the wordpress blog that I am currently using to test the application

what is DOM?
how to use Javascript to do things here?
what are shadow roots?
